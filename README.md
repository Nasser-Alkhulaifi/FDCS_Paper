This project presents a machine learning pipeline designed to forecast energy consumption and environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) in food and drink cold storage rooms. The pipeline integrates data preprocessing, automated feature engineering, and predictive modelling to support sustainable energy management.

The work contributes to improving operational efficiency and environmental monitoring in cold storage facilities.
