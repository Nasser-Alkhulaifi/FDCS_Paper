# **Machine Learning Pipeline for Energy and Environmental Prediction in Cold Storage Facilities**

## Overview

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper **"Machine Learning Pipeline for Energy and Environmental Prediction in Cold Storage Facilities"**, submitted to *IEEE Access*. The project focuses on predicting energy consumption and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) in cold storage facilities using a machine learning pipeline. The goal is to optimise energy usage while maintaining appropriate environmental conditions.

**Note:** The dataset used in the paper is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly. You may apply the pipeline to your data using the provided code structure.
